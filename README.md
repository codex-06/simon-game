# simon-game

This is a web-based version of the classic Simon Says game, implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The game consists of a sequence of colors that the user must replicate by clicking on the corresponding buttons. The sequence starts with a single color, and each time the user successfully completes the sequence, another color is added to the end, making the sequence longer and more challenging.

# Installation
No installation is required, as the game is completely web-based and can be played directly in a web browser.

# Usage
To play the game, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Once the game has loaded, click anywhere on the screen to start. The game will then play a sequence of colors, which the user must replicate by clicking on the corresponding buttons. Each time the user successfully completes the sequence, another color is added to the end, making the game more challenging.

If the user makes a mistake and clicks on the wrong button, the game will end and display a "Game Over" message. The user can then choose to retry the game by clicking on the "Retry?" message.
